# PVAC Doping Agents Research Project
### *Adam Rankin, Henry Bruin*
#### *University of Western Ontario*
The purpose of this project is to research and analyze different possible doping agents for **PVAC**. The main method of imaging will be done with the use of ultrasound.

#### Next Steps
The next priority will be to start the process of making new phantoms to image. A way to store the samples is currently being researched. Titanium Dioxide will most likely be the next doping agent tested.
