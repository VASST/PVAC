# PVAC Doping Agents Research Project
### *Adam Rankin, Henry Bruin*
#### *University of Western Ontario*
The purpose of this project is to research and analyze different possible doping agents for **PVAC**. The main method of imaging will be done with the use of ultrasound.

#### Possible Agents
1. Spheriglass
- Will not decompose
2. Titanium Dioxide (Ti0<sub>2</sub>)
- Commonly used in labs around the world
3. Caffeine Powder
4. Aspirin Powder
5. Talcum Powder
#### Next Steps
The next priority will be to start the process of making new phantoms to image. As they do not last, they will need to be imaged as soon as they have been made. Titanium Dioxide will most likely be the next doping agent tested.
